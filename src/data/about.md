I am an entrepreneurial Strategy and Innovation Leader,
experienced in high-growth startups to global organizations. As
a business builder, I combine strong data-driven insights,
enterprise market strategy, and creating innovative solutions
that build and optimize sustainable revenue. I am passionate
about enabling organizations to creatively conjure wild ideas
that make a game-changing impact and result in disruptive
innovation. My customer obsession is only surpassed by my drive
to analyze data to make the right data-driven business
decisions, gain untapped customer insights, and translate them
into effective strategies for executable operational plans.
